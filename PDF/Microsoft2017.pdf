website 16 PART Item 1A ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers Competition among platforms ecosystems and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions well established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services competing vertically integrated model in which single firm controls the software and hardware elements of product and related services has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers tablets phones gaming consoles and wearables Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform We also offer some vertically integrated hardware and software products and services To the extent we shift portion of our business to vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers Even if many users view these devices as complementary to personal computer the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins In addition some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners which may affect their commitment to our platform Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases The variety and utility of content and applications available on platform are important to device purchasing decisions Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms To compete we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality customer appeal and value Efforts to compete with competitors content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins Business model competition Companies compete with us based on growing variety of business models Even as we transition more of our business to services and subscription business model the license based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model 17 PART Item 1A Other competitors develop and offer free applications online services and content and make money by selling third party advertising Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost competing directly with our revenue generating products Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end users and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality of our products The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions and or increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives This may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks growing part of our business involves cloud based services available across the spectrum of computing devices Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best in class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based services for consumers and business customers Pricing and delivery models are evolving Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user choice of which suite of cloud based services to use We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud based strategies The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation The Company investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment Besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved Whether we succeed in cloud based services depends on our execution in several areas including Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share Maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloud based services on the growing array of computing devices including PCs smartphones tablets gaming consoles and other television related devices Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third party developers Ensuring our cloud based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data Making our suite of cloud based services platform agnostic available on wide range of devices and ecosystems including those of our competitors It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income We make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns We will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the Windows operating system the Microsoft Office system Bing Windows Server the Windows Store the Microsoft Azure Services platform Office 365 other cloud based offerings and the Xbox entertainment platform We also invest in the development and acquisition of variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including PCs tablets gaming devices and HoloLens Investments in new technology are speculative Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue We may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and 18 PART Item 1A distribution channel investments for several years if at all New products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically We did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure positive experience for our users installing Windows 10 However negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies In addition we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues Our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues Finally our practices for data collection use and management in Windows 10 are subject to regulatory review and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines If so we could face negative public reaction degraded user experiences and reduced flexibility in product design Developing new technologies is complex It can require long development and testing periods Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue Acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long term business strategy In December 2016 we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn for 27 billion The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We test goodwill for impairment at least annually Factors that may be change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate We may be required to record significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations For example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we recorded billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded 480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business Our acquisition of LinkedIn resulted in significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on global basis is difficult While piracy adversely affects revenue the impact on revenue from outside the is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market Similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights Throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of business climate where intellectual property rights are protected Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 19 PART Item 1A We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for royalty Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents Similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations Finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights From time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of first party devices such as Surface and Lumia phones To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline Besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies In some countries such as Germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code Source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code If significant portion of our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph Cyber attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position Security of Microsoft information technology Threats to IT security can take variety of forms Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including state sponsored organizations or nation states continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT These actors may use wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data or acting in coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks Cyber threats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business In addition our internal IT environment continues to evolve Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer oriented technologies Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge 20 PART Item 1A Security of our products services devices and customers data The Security of our products and services is important in our customers decisions to purchase or use our products or services Security threats are challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers Customers using our cloud based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue Hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords To defend against security threats both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti virus software The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins If we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services Customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patches Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services Disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud based offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers The continued occurrence of high profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage Improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premises or increasingly in cloud based environment we host Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders In the and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure Despite our efforts to protect customer data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud based solutions by consumers businesses and government entities Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses We may have outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure Our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power We spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing Exchange Online Microsoft Azure Microsoft Account services Office 365 OneDrive SharePoint Online Skype Xbox Live Outlook com and Windows Stores We are rapidly growing our business of providing platform and back end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users Maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve Inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 21 PART Item 1A Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products As leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under and foreign competition laws An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union EU the and China Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti competitive conduct federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business The European Commission the Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws For example in 2004 the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products In 2009 the Commission accepted set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability The web browsing commitments expired in 2014 The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform and increase our product development costs The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products Our portfolio of first party devices continues to grow at the same time our OEM partners offer large variety of devices on our platforms As result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners creating risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase Certain foreign governments particularly in China and other countries in Asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws their enforcement activities are unpredictable Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them New competition law actions could be initiated The outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in variety of ways including We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings which may entail delay in product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings We are subject to variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken If we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post sale monetization opportunities may be limited Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti corruption trade protection and other laws and regulations The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti corruption laws and regulations Anti Corruption Laws prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents From time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the and our compliance with Anti Corruption Laws Specifically we have been cooperating with authorities in the in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies Our failure to comply with Anti Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation Operations outside the may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of trade sanctions on countries such as Iran North Korea Cuba Sudan and Syria 22 PART Item 1A Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content For example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services Data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Additionally these laws and governments approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us The growth of our Internet and cloud based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries Legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve For example the EU and the formally entered into new framework in July 2016 that provides mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the This new framework called the Privacy Shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in predecessor mechanism The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are subject to review by the European courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic In 2016 the EU adopted new law governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which becomes effective in May 2018 The law requires firms to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data Engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects If we are unable to engineer products that meet Microsoft legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings Non compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to of worldwide revenue Ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data Compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreign based firms Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws Changes to immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Effective succession planning is also important to our long term success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution How employment related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes We are subject to variety of claims and lawsuits These claims may arise from wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as Windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management view of these matters may change in the future material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the and many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of an audit or litigation could have material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 23 PART Item 1A We earn significant amount of our operating income from outside the and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the may result in higher effective tax rates for the company In addition there have been proposals from Congress to change tax laws that would significantly impact how multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems Our vertically integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles Surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software We could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs We acquire some device components from sole suppliers Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us If component from sole source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales Component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue Xbox consoles Surface devices and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins These same risks would apply to any other vertically integrated hardware and software products we may offer Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors and customers to make technology more accessible If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks Our customers are located in over 200 countries and significant part of our revenue comes from international sales The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks Emerging markets are significant focus of our international growth strategy The developing nature of these markets presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations Although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the and other countries Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of major earthquake weather event cyber attack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions Our corporate headquarters significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle Washington area and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California both of which are seismically active regions catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results 24 PART Item 1A Abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public sector customers Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment Changes to trade policy or agreements may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues The long term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear Environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud based services Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business Worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue If demand for PCs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected Substantial revenue comes from our government contracts An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network OEMs building devices that run our software have also been significant means of distribution The impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of major distributor OEM or retailer could cause sales channel disruption Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased As result allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities These investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets significant part of our investment portfolio comprises government securities If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods or if there is downgrade of the government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results Changes in our sales organization may impact revenues In July 2017 we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers digital transformation add greater technical ability to our sales force and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries The reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in Microsoft history involving employees changing roles adding additional talent realigning teams and onboarding new partners Successfully executing these changes will be significant factor in enabling future revenue growth As we navigate through this transition sales profitability and cash flow could be adversely impacted 25 PART Item 1B ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income 38 PART II Item taxes between the and foreign countries The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances Our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland Singapore and Puerto Rico Additionally our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses The mix of income before income taxes between the and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our regional operating center while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers In fiscal year 2017 our income before income taxes was 453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was

year 2016 we remain under audit for those years We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016 In February 2012 the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination As of June 30 2017 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate We have not received proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months Based on the information currently available we do not anticipate significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15 and 34 respectively Our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland Singapore and Puerto Rico The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the and foreign countries including the impact of net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock based compensation and distributions from foreign affiliates The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize tax benefit primarily as result of impairment and

products and services We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our regional operating center while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers In fiscal year 2016 our loss before income taxes was 325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was 20 billion Net revenue

June 30 2016 Our short term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities diversified among industries and individual issuers The investments are predominantly dollar denominated securities but also include foreign currency denominated securities to diversify risk Our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed income indices The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities Of the cash cash equivalents and short term investments as of June 30 2017 127 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects The amount of cash cash equivalents and short term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was

invested in mortgage and asset backed securities and approximately were invested in corporate notes and bonds of companies all of which are denominated in dollars The remaining cash equivalents and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities Securities lending We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets Cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower Cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with corresponding liability Our securities lending payable balance was 97 million as of June 30 2017 Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2017 were 484 million and billion respectively Intra year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities Valuation In general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments This pricing methodology applies to our Level investments such as government securities domestic and international equities and exchange traded mutual funds If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly This pricing methodology applies to our Level investments such as foreign government bonds corporate notes and bonds mortgage and asset backed securities government and agency securities common and preferred stock and certificates of deposit Level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level or Level investments as these vendors either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments Broker pricing is used mainly when quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades Our broker priced investments are generally classified as Level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments In addition all our broker priced investments have sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of period over period fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 40 PART II Item Cash Flows Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Cash from operations

our customers choose to license cloud based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction based products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption as applicable Share Repurchases During fiscal year 2017 2016 and 2015 we repurchased 170 million shares 294 million shares and 295 million shares of our common stock for 10 billion 14 billion and 13 billion respectively through our share repurchase programs All repurchases were made using cash resources See Note 18 Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item of this Form 10 for further discussion Dividends See Note 18 Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial

property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters Additionally we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make reasonable estimate of the amount of loss These obligations did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30 2017 In millions 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Long term debt Principal

long term pension liabilities of 14 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain We have also excluded unearned revenue and non cash items 42 PART II Item Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy Additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings We have operating leases for most and international sales and support offices and certain equipment We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources Liquidity We earn significant amount of our operating income outside the which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions As result as discussed above under Cash Cash Equivalents and Investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and short term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries We currently do not intend nor foresee need to repatriate these funds We expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents short term investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt maturities and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future In addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents short term investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future Should we require more capital in the than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the through debt or equity issuances These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item of this Form 10 for further discussion APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses These estimates and assumptions are affected by management application of accounting policies Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products Certain volume licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 43 PART II Item Software updates are evaluated on case by case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered If it is determined that implied post contract customer support PCS is being provided revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware Where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under GAAP revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered We use hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements vendor specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii third party evidence and iii best estimate of selling price ESP For software elements we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value Generally VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on stand alone basis Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Customers purchasing Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on stand alone basis we are unable to establish VSOE Accordingly revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which ranges between two to four years The new standard related to revenue recognition will have material impact on our consolidated financial statements See Note Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item of this Form 10 for further discussion Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment This determination requires significant judgment In making this judgment we employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment For fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established If market industry and or investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below its carrying value These events or circumstances could include significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of significant portion of reporting unit Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of discounted cash flow methodology This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 44 PART II Item The estimates used to calculate the fair value of reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product Once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of product is established We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing Generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty An estimated loss from loss contingency such as legal proceeding or claim is accrued by charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated In determining whether loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make reasonable estimate of the amount of loss Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends If our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue 45 PART II Item STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report The consolidated financial statements which include amounts based on management estimates and judgments have been

PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our consolidated financial statements Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions Principal currencies hedged include the euro Japanese yen British pound Canadian dollar and Australian dollar Interest Rate Our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investment grade securities The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices In addition we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage backed securities Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices Commodity We use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification Our investment portfolio has exposure to variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices VALUE AT RISK We use value at risk VaR model to estimate and quantify our market risks VaR is the expected loss for given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over defined time horizon The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with GAAP but is used as risk estimation and management tool The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 000 cases Several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk 47 PART II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30 2017 and 2016 and for the year ended June 30 2017 In millions June 30 2017 June 30 2016 Year Ended June 30 2017 Risk Categories Average High Low Foreign currency 114 92 169 303 88 Interest rate 152 58 113 155 57 Equity 54 157 121 165 54 Commodity 12 12 Total one day VaR for the combined risk categories was 207 million and 225 million as of June 30 2017 and 2016 The total VaR is 35 and 29 less as of June 30 2017 and 2016 respectively than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks 48 PART II Item ITEM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

notes 53 PART II Item NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee activities are accounted for using the equity method Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses Examples of estimates include loss contingencies product warranties the fair value of and or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units product life cycles useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for product returns the market value of and demand for our inventory and stock based compensation forfeiture rates Examples of assumptions include the elements comprising software arrangement including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products when technological feasibility is achieved for our products the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and determining when investment impairments are other than temporary Actual results and outcomes may differ from management estimates and assumptions Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income OCI Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems cross device productivity applications server applications business solution applications desktop and server management tools software development tools video games hardware such as PCs tablets gaming and entertainment consoles phones other intelligent devices and related accessories and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud based solutions that provide customers with software services platforms and content such as Microsoft Office 365 Microsoft Azure Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Xbox Live solution support and consulting services Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 54 PART II Item Revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware Where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under GAAP revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered We use hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements vendor specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii third party evidence and iii best estimate of selling price ESP For software elements we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value Generally VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on stand alone basis Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Revenue for retail packaged products products licensed to original equipment manufacturers OEMs and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on case by case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create multiple element arrangement which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered or if it is determined that implied post contract customer support PCS is being provided the arrangement is accounted for as multiple element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available Customers purchasing Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on stand alone basis we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value Accordingly revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which ranges between two to four years Certain volume licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period Arrangements that include term based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period are also accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period Revenue from cloud based services arrangements that allow for the use of hosted software product or service over contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers Revenue from cloud based services arrangements that are provided on consumption basis for example the amount of storage used in particular period is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources Some volume licensing arrangements include time based subscriptions for cloud based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions These arrangements are considered multiple element arrangements However because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern they have the same revenue recognition timing 55 PART II Item Revenue related to Surface devices Xbox consoles games published by us phones and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements and or services Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period Consulting revenue for fixed price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space costs incurred to support and maintain Internet based products and services including datacenter costs and royalties warranty costs inventory valuation adjustments costs associated with the delivery of consulting services and the amortization of capitalized software development costs Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized For hardware warranties we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over period generally ranging from 90 days to three years For software warranties we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the estimated life of the software We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll employee benefits stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with product development Research and development expenses also include third party development and programming costs localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released to production Once technological feasibility is reached such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll employee benefits stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising promotions trade shows seminars and other programs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred Advertising expense was billion billion and billion in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Stock Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards which include restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense net of estimated forfeitures over the related service or performance period The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period We measure the fair value of PSUs using Monte Carlo valuation model Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method 56 PART II Item Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ESPP is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase Income Taxes Income tax expense includes and international income taxes the provision for taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes Deferred tax assets are reported net of valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized All deferred income taxes are classified as long term on our consolidated balance sheets Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety These levels are Level inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets Our Level non derivative investments primarily include government securities domestic and international equities and actively traded mutual funds Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges Level inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques the Black Scholes model for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves credit spreads foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities Our Level non derivative investments consist primarily of foreign government bonds corporate notes and bonds mortgage and asset backed securities government and agency securities common and preferred stock and certificates of deposit Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over the counter option and swap contracts Level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models Our Level non derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock and goodwill and intangible assets when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities We measure certain assets including our cost and equity method investments at fair value on nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest earning investments with maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values In general investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term 57 PART II Item based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations All cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in market value excluding other than temporary impairments are reflected in OCI Equity and other investments classified as long term include both debt and equity instruments Debt and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in the market value of available for sale securities excluding other than temporary impairments are reflected in OCI Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets Cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower Cash received is recorded as an asset with corresponding liability Investments are considered to be impaired when decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management We employ systematic methodology on quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment For fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For options designated as fair value hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivatives is initially reported as component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings Gains losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges gains losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income expense net Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes such as commodity contracts the gains losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains losses in the underlying available for sale securities which are recorded as component of OCI until the securities are sold or other than temporarily impaired at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI into other income expense net 58 PART II Item Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows In millions Year Ended June 30 2017 2016 2015 Balance beginning of period 426 335 301 Charged to costs and other 85 146 77 Write offs 106 55 43 Balance end of period 405 426 335 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory If our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows computer software developed or acquired for internal use three to seven years computer equipment two to three years buildings and improvements five to 15 years leasehold improvements three to 20 years and furniture and equipment one to 10 years Land is not depreciated Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below its carrying value Intangible Assets All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to 15 years We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired Recent Accounting Guidance Accounting for Income Taxes Intra Entity Asset Transfers In October 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party This guidance is effective for us beginning July 2018 with early adoption permitted beginning July 2017 We plan to adopt the guidance effective July 2018 Adoption of the guidance will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date cumulative effect adjustment will capture the write off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current GAAP We anticipate this guidance will have material impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption and continue to evaluate any impacts to our accounting policies processes and systems 59 PART II Item Financial Instruments Credit Losses In June 2016 the FASB issued new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates We will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables loans and other financial instruments Credit losses relating to available for sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning July 2019 Adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems Leases In February 2016 the FASB issued new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right of use ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP Under the standard disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases We will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using modified retrospective approach with certain practical expedients available The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2019 with early adoption permitted We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition We elected the available practical expedients on adoption In preparation for adoption of the standard we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information The standard will have material impact on our consolidated balance sheets but will not have material impact on our consolidated income statements The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases while our accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of billion and billion as of June 30 2017 and 2016 respectively See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements Financial Instruments Recognition Measurement Presentation and Disclosure In January 2016 the FASB issued new standard related to certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments with certain exceptions to be recognized through net income rather than OCI The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2018 Adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014 the FASB issued new standard related to revenue recognition Under the standard revenue is recognized when customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services In addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers The guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective method We will adopt the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented 60 PART II Item The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2018 with early adoption permitted We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 2017 In preparation for adoption of the standard we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments related to the standard including our assessment that the impact of accounting for costs incurred to obtain contract is immaterial The most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue Specifically for Windows 10 we will recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device For certain multi year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing Revenue recognition related to our hardware cloud offerings such as Office 365 LinkedIn and professional services will remain substantially unchanged Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of billion and billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016 respectively and an increase in the provision for income taxes of billion and billion respectively primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition In addition adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long term assets of billion and billion as of June 30 2017 and 2016 respectively driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance reduction of unearned revenue of 17 billion and 11 billion as of June 30 2017 and 2016 respectively driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi year commercial software subscriptions and an increase in deferred income taxes of billion and billion as of June 30 2017 and 2016 respectively driven by the upfront recognition of revenue See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our

business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations as applicable Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30 2017 and 2016 was 11 billion Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May at the reporting unit level primarily using discounted cash flow methodology with peer based risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital We believe use of discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses Effective May 2017 we prospectively adopted accounting guidance that simplifies our goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill formerly Step in the event that an impairment is identified Instead an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit carrying amount over its fair value No instances of impairment were identified in our May 2017 or May 2016 test During fiscal year 2015 we recorded impairment charges of billion related to goodwill in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 2015 our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired In the second half of fiscal year 2015 Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned These results along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities led to shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business As result of these changes in strategy and expectations we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required 74 PART II Item Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value Step of the goodwill impairment test was performed specific to Phone Hardware Under Step the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated including tangible assets existing technology patent agreements and contractual arrangements for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets NOTE 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS The components of intangible assets all of which are finite lived were as follows In millions Gross

rates 15 19 20 Phone business losses 19 Excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation Domestic production activities deduction Interest net Other reconciling items net Effective rate 15 34

technology related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing broad range of cellular technologies IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia Corporation Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators In November 2014 Microsoft and IPCom entered into standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions which continue InterDigital patent litigation InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation collectively IDT filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission ITC and in District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013 We were added to these cases as defendant after we acquired the Nokia phone business Each of the ITC matters was resolved in our favor In September 2015 in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case IDT appeal of this decision was heard by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April 2017 and the Delaware case was stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section of the Sherman Act alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents Microsoft and IDT settled these cases in May 2017 and they have been dismissed European copyright levies We assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia alleged failure to pay private copyright levies in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory The levies are based upon 2001 European Union EU Directive establishing right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones regardless of actual usage of that memory The most significant cases against Nokia were pending in Germany and Austria due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries We reached settlement of the Austrian case in August 2016 In Germany the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 through 2007 In July 2016 the German Supreme Court heard our appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five megabytes of memory The Supreme Court issued ruling in December 2016 finding that the levy may not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive music files only via Bluetooth or infrared inputs and remanded for further proceedings new case schedule has not been set and we have reached tentative settlement Other patent and intellectual property claims In addition to the IPCom cases there were 41 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30 2017 Antitrust Unfair Competition and Overcharge Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia Ontario and Quebec Canada All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010 The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016 The plaintiffs filed their case in chief in August 2016 setting out claims made authorities and evidence in support of their claims six month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in September 2017 consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive 84 PART II Item Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation In 2014 Microsoft was informed that China State Administration for Industry and Commerce SAIC had begun formal investigation relating to China Anti Monopoly Law and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Chengdu SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility bundle sales file verification issues related to Windows and Office software and potentially other issues Product Related Litigation cell phone litigation Nokia along with other handset manufacturers and network operators is defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of Nokia Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre trial proceedings the remaining 10 cases are stayed In separate 2009 decision the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines FCC Guidelines are pre empted by federal law The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect The lawsuits also allege an industry wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines In 2013 defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies In 2014 the trial court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to exclude plaintiffs general causation experts The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals heard en banc In October 2016 the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard Plaintiffs have filed motion to reopen discovery and file additional expert evidence Canadian cell phone class action Nokia along with other handset manufacturers and network operators is defendant in 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 600 hours including subclass of users with brain tumors Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants The litigation has been dormant for more than two years Other Contingencies We also are subject to variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us individually or in aggregate will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management view of these matters may change in the future As of June 30 2017 we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of 352 million While we intend to defend these matters vigorously adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur there exists the possibility of material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable 85 PART II Item Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters Additionally we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make reasonable estimate of the amount of loss To date we have not encountered significant costs as result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements NOTE 18 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows In millions Year Ended June 30 2017
