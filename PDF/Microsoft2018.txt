Relations website 16 PART Item 1A ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers Competition among platform based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions well established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms competing vertically integrated model in which single firm controls the software and hardware elements of product and related services has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers tablets phones gaming consoles and wearables Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer We also offer some vertically integrated hardware and software products and services To the extent we shift portion of our business to vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers Even if many users view these devices as complementary to personal computer the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength In addition some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer OEM partners which may affect their commitment to our platform Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases The variety and utility of content and applications available on platform are important to device purchasing decisions Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms To compete we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality security customer appeal and value Efforts to compete with competitors content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins 17 PART Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on growing variety of business models Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure platform and software as service business model the license based proprietary software model generates substantial portion of our software revenue We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model Other competitors develop and offer free applications online services and content and make money by selling third party advertising Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost competing directly with our revenue generating products Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end users and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality of our products The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions and or increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives This may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income Our increasing focus on cloud based services presents execution and competitive risks growing part of our business involves cloud based services available across the spectrum of computing devices Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best in class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence AI At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based services for consumers and business customers Pricing and delivery models are evolving Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user choice of which suite of cloud based services to use We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud based strategies The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things IoT Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Microsoft Azure Azure Stack Azure IoT Edge and Azure Sphere We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives Besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved Whether we succeed in cloud based services depends on our execution in several areas including Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share Maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloud based services on the growing array of computing devices including PCs smartphones tablets gaming consoles and other devices as well as sensors and other endpoints Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third party developers Ensuring our cloud based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data Making our suite of cloud based services platform agnostic available on wide range of devices and ecosystems including those of our competitors It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 18 PART Item 1A We make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns We will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the Windows operating system Microsoft 365 Office Bing Microsoft SQL Server Windows Server the Windows Store Azure Office 365 Xbox Live Mixer LinkedIn and other cloud based offerings We also invest in the development and acquisition of variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including PCs tablets gaming devices and HoloLens Investments in new technology are speculative Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue We may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all New products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically We may not get engagement in certain features like Windows Store Microsoft Edge and Bing that drive post license monetization opportunities Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality Developing new technologies is complex It can require long development and testing periods Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue Acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long term business strategy In December 2016 we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for 27 billion In June 2018 we announced an agreement to acquire GitHub Inc for billion These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We test goodwill for impairment at least annually Factors that may be change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate We have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations Our acquisition of LinkedIn resulted in significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on global basis is difficult While piracy adversely affects revenue the impact on revenue from outside the is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market Similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights Throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of business climate where intellectual property rights are protected Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 19 PART Item 1A We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for royalty Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents Similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations Finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements Finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights From time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of first party devices such as Microsoft Surface To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline Besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies In some countries such as Germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure Source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code If our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take variety of forms Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including state sponsored organizations or nation states continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT These actors may use wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data or acting in coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data For example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users security or systems or reveal confidential information 20 PART Item 1A Cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers Breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business In addition our internal IT environment continues to evolve Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer oriented technologies Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge Security of our products services devices and customers data The security of our products and services is important in our customers decisions to purchase or use our products or services Security threats are significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers Customers using our cloud based services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems our cloud based services and our customers systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins If we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services Customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our reputation and revenue Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges At times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers As illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across broad ecosystem If there is security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position 21 PART Item 1A Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud based offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users The continued occurrence of high profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage In addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on premises or increasingly in cloud based environment we host Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders In the and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud based solutions by consumers businesses and government entities Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures In certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services Abuse of our advertising or social platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement For LinkedIn Bing Ads and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate to other people by users impersonating other people or organizations by use of our products or services to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or by the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends Preventing these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and financial results We may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure Our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power We spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing Exchange Online Azure Microsoft account services Office 365 OneDrive SharePoint Online Skype Xbox Live Outlook com and Windows Stores We are rapidly growing our business of providing platform and back end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users Maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve Inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 22 PART Item 1A Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products As leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under and foreign competition laws An increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union EU the and China Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti competitive conduct federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business The European Commission the Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws For example in 2004 the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products In 2009 the Commission accepted set of commitments we offered to address the Commission concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability The web browsing commitments expired in 2014 The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform and increase our product development costs The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products Our portfolio of first party devices continues to grow at the same time our OEM partners offer large variety of devices on our platforms As result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners creating risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase Certain foreign governments particularly in China and other countries in Asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them New competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent The outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in variety of ways including We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings which may entail delay in product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property We are subject to variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken If we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post sale monetization opportunities may be limited 23 PART Item 1A Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti corruption trade protection and other laws and regulations The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti corruption laws and regulations Anti Corruption Laws prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents From time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the and our compliance with Anti Corruption Laws Specifically we have been cooperating with authorities in the in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies Our failure to comply with Anti Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation Operations outside the may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of trade sanctions on countries such as Iran North Korea Cuba Sudan and Syria Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content For example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and new laws may define more of our services as regulated telecommunications services Data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations Legislative or regulatory action relating cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services Legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of AI increasing costs or restricting opportunity Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Additionally these laws and governments approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors and customers to make technology more accessible If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage The growth of our Internet and cloud based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries Legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve For example the EU and the formally entered into new framework in July 2016 that provides mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the This framework called the Privacy Shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in predecessor mechanism The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic The Privacy Shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets In May 2018 new EU law governing data practices and privacy the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR became effective The law which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU imposes range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data Engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with the GDPR make our offerings less attractive The GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators apply and interpret them If we fail to comply with the GDPR or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to of worldwide revenue private lawsuits or reputational damage 24 PART Item 1A The Company investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment Ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreign based firms Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive Maintaining our brand and reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws Changes to immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Effective succession planning is also important to our long term success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution How employment related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes We are subject to variety of claims and lawsuits These claims may arise from wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as Windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management view of these matters may change in the future material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the and many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes In the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain For example compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act TCJA may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company the use of estimates in our financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to TCJA and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of an audit or litigation could have material effect in our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made We earn significant amount of our operating income outside the change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company In addition changes in federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 25 PART Item 1A We may experience quality or supply problems Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles Surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software We could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us If component from sole source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity Component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue Xbox consoles Surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins These same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks Our customers are located in over 200 countries and significant part of our revenue comes from international sales The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks Our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes In addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment Changes to trade policy or agreements as result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs Although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions Our corporate headquarters significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle Washington area and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California both of which are seismically active regions catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results 26 PART Item 1A Abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability Geopolit ical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public sector customers Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues The long term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear Environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud based services Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business Worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue If demand for PCs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected Substantial revenue comes from our government contracts An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network OEMs building devices that run our software have also been significant means of distribution The impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of major distributor OEM or retailer could cause sales channel disruption Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased As result allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities These investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets significant part of our investment portfolio comprises government securities If global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is downgrade of the government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results Changes in our sales organization may impact revenues In July 2017 we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers digital transformation add greater technical ability to our sales force and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries The reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in our history involving employees changing roles adding additional talent realigning teams and onboarding new partners Successfully executing these changes will be significant factor in enabling future revenue growth As we continue to navigate through this transition sales profitability and cash flow could be adversely impacted The development of the internet of things presents security privacy and execution risks To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the IoT network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including AI The IoT great potential also carries substantial risks IoT products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control Each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions These risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins 27 PART Item 1A Issues in the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow We envision future in which AI operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives As with many disruptive innovat ions AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business AI algorithms may be flawed Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions These deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis AI applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm Some AI scenarios present ethical issues If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social issues we may experience brand or reputational harm If our reputation or our brands are damaged our business and operating results may be harmed Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and public sector customers There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged These include product safety or quality issues or our environmental impact supply chain practices or human rights record We may experience backlash from customers government entities advocacy groups employees and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from among other things The introduction of new features products services or terms of service that customers users or partners do not like Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy data practices or content Data security breaches compliance failures or actions of partners or individual employees The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events If our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees 28 PART Item 1B ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written

2017 was 55 and 15 respectively The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017 Our effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland Singapore and Puerto Rico The mix of income before income taxes between the and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for

Legislation On December 22 2017 the TCJA was enacted into law which significantly changes existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business such as imposing one time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income reducing the federal statutory tax rate and adopting territorial tax system The TCJA required us to incur one time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to income tax at rate of 15 for foreign cash and certain other net current assets and on the remaining income The TCJA also reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 2018 For fiscal year 2018 our blended federal statutory tax rate is 28 This is the result of using the tax rate of 35 for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21 for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 The TCJA includes provision to tax global intangible low taxed income GILTI of foreign subsidiaries and base erosion anti abuse tax BEAT measure that taxes certain payments between corporation and its foreign subsidiaries The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning July 2018 The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 As of June 30 2018 we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA During fiscal year 2018 we recorded provisional net charge of 13 billion related to the TCJA based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the TCJA the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the TCJA collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance issued by the Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service IRS Financial Accounting Standards Board and other standard setting and regulatory bodies Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made Our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date During fiscal year 2018 we recorded an estimated net charge of 13 billion related to the TCJA due to the impact of the one time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of 17 billion offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of billion primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities Uncertain Tax Positions While we settled portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 we remain under audit for those years In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 we settled portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 We continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2017 In February 2012 the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination As of June 30 2018 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have significant impact in our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate We have not received proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months Based on the information currently available we do not anticipate significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted operating income net income and diluted earnings per share are non GAAP financial measures which exclude the net charge related to the TCJA and impairment and restructuring expenses We believe these non GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business For comparability of reporting management considers non GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance These non GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP 42 PART II Item The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non GAAP financial results In millions except percentages and per share

and other investments were billion and billion as of June 30 2018 and 2017 respectively Our short term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities diversified among industries and individual issuers The investments are predominantly dollar denominated securities but also include foreign currency denominated securities to diversify risk Our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed income indices The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities As result of the TCJA our cash cash equivalents and short term investments held by foreign subsidiaries are no longer subject to tax on repatriation into the Valuation In general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments This pricing methodology applies to our Level investments such as government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly This pricing methodology applies to our Level investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgage and asset backed securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and agency securities Level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 43 PART II Item majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level or Level investments as these vendors either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments Broker pricing is used mainly when quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades Our broker priced investments are generally classified as Level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments In addition all our broker priced investments have sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of period over period fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Cash from operations increased billion to 43 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30 2018 mainly due to an increase in cash received from

assumptions are affected by management application of accounting policies Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When cloud based service includes both on premises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 46 PART II Item Judgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including on premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers Our products are generally sold with right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented The new standard related to revenue recognition had material impact in our consolidated financial statements Refer to Note Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item of this Form 10 for further discussion Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment This determination requires significant judgment In making this judgment we employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment For fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established If market industry and or investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below its carrying value These events or circumstances could include significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of significant portion of reporting unit Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of discounted cash flow methodology This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 47 PART II Item The estimates used to calculate the fair value of reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product Once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of product is established We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing Generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty An estimated loss from loss contingency such as legal proceeding or claim is accrued by charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated In determining whether loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make reasonable estimate of the amount of loss Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements The TCJA significantly changes existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business Refer to Note 13 Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item of this Form 10 for further discussion Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends If our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue 48 PART II Item STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report The consolidated financial statements which include amounts based on management estimates and judgments have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The Company

Vice President Finance and Administration Chief Accounting Officer 49 PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates interest rates credit risk and equity prices We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks however they may still impact our consolidated financial statements Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions Principal currencies hedged include the euro Japanese yen British pound Canadian dollar and Australian dollar Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities We manage the average maturity of the fixed income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed income indices Credit Our fixed income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities We manage credit exposures relative to broad based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Historically we used value at risk VaR model to estimate and quantify our market risks This included presenting one day VaR as well as average high and low VaR by risk category throughout the reporting period Given the changes in size and allocation of our portfolio of financial assets we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as result of market movements Therefore we have presented sensitivity analysis for each risk category below Sensitivity analysis is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America but is used as risk estimation and management tool The following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values including associated derivatives resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices In millions Risk Categories Hypothetical Change

Refer to accompanying notes 55 PART II Item NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP We have recast certain prior period income tax liabilities as discussed in the Recent Tax Legislation section below We have also recast prior period securities lending payables to other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation These items had no impact in our consolidated income statements or net cash from or used in operating financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Equity investments for which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee activities are accounted for using the equity method Investments for which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses Examples of estimates and assumptions include for revenue recognition determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining the standalone selling price SSP of performance obligations variable consideration and other obligations such as product returns and refunds loss contingencies product warranties the fair value of and or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units product life cycles useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets allowances for doubtful accounts the market value of and demand for our inventory stock based compensation forfeiture rates when technological feasibility is achieved for our products the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and determining when investment impairments are other than temporary Actual results and outcomes may differ from management estimates and assumptions Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income OCI Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems cross device productivity applications server applications business solution applications desktop and server management tools software development tools video games and hardware such as PCs tablets gaming and entertainment consoles other intelligent devices and related accessories Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud based solutions that provide customers with software services platforms and content such as Microsoft Office 365 Microsoft Azure Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Xbox Live solution support and consulting services Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn 56 PART II Item Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on premises software provide the customer with right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Revenue from distinct on premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge revenue is recognized as the updates are provided which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license Certain volume licensing programs including Enterprise Agreements include on premises licenses combined with Software Assurance SA SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently On premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time Cloud services which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software are provided on either subscription or consumption basis Revenue related to cloud services provided on subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period Revenue related to cloud services provided on consumption basis such as the amount of storage used in period is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources When cloud services require significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided Our hardware is generally highly dependent on and interrelated with the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system In these cases the hardware and software license are accounted for as single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces Refer to Note 21 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information including revenue by significant product and service offering Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When cloud based service includes both on premises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 57 PART II Item Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including on premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers Our products are generally sold with right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers We record receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing For multi year agreements we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period We record receivable related to revenue recognized for multi year on premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses The opening balance of current and long term accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was 22 billion as of July 2016 As of June 30 2018 and 2017 long term accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts were billion and billion respectively and are included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows In millions Year Ended June 30 2018 2017 2016 Balance beginning of period 361 409 289 Charged to costs and other 134 58 175 Write offs 98 106 55 Balance end of period 397 361 409 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets June 30 2018 2017 2016 Accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts 377 345 392 Other long term assets 20 16 17 Total 397 361 409 58 PART II Item Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs which may include SA and cloud services Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future LinkedIn subscriptions Office 365 subscriptions Xbox Live subscriptions Windows 10 post delivery support Dynamics business solutions Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service Refer to Note 15 Unearned Revenue for further information including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type although terms generally include requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing we have determined our contracts generally do not include significant financing component The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing Examples include invoicing at the beginning of subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period and multi year on premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain Contract with Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining contract with customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized Total capitalized costs to obtain contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets We apply practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain contract with customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers OEM to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space costs incurred to support and maintain Internet based products and services including datacenter costs and royalties warranty costs inventory valuation adjustments costs associated with the delivery of consulting services and the amortization of capitalized software development costs Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized For hardware warranties we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over period generally ranging from 90 days to three years For software warranties we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the estimated life of the software We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 59 PART II Item Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll employee benefits stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with product development Research and development expenses also include third party development and programming costs localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released to production Once technological feasibility is reached such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll employee benefits stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising promotions trade shows seminars and other programs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred Advertising expense was billion billion and billion in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Stock Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards which include restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense net of estimated forfeitures over the related service or performance period The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period We measure the fair value of PSUs using Monte Carlo valuation model Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ESPP is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase Income Taxes Income tax expense includes and international income taxes and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes Deferred tax assets are reported net of valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized All deferred income taxes are classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheets 60 PART II Item Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety These levels are Level inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets Our Level non derivative investments primarily include government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges Level inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques the Black Scholes model for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves credit spreads foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies Our Level non derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgage and asset backed securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and agency securities Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over the counter option and swap contracts Level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models Our Level non derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock and goodwill and intangible assets when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities We measure certain assets including our cost and equity method investments at fair value on nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest earning investments with maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values In general investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations All cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in market value excluding other than temporary impairments are reflected in OCI Equity and other investments classified as long term include both debt and equity instruments Debt and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in the market value of available for sale securities excluding other than temporary impairments are reflected in OCI Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method 61 PART II Item We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments in our consolidated balance sheets Cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower Cash received is recorded as an asset with corresponding liability Investments are considered to be impaired when decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management We employ systematic methodology on quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment For fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For options designated as fair value hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivatives is initially reported as component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings Gains losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges gains losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income expense net Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory If our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows computer software developed or acquired for internal use three to seven years computer equipment two to three years buildings and improvements five to 15 years leasehold improvements three to 20 years and furniture and equipment one to 10 years Land is not depreciated 62 PART II Item Leases We determine if an arrangement is lease at inception Operating leases are included in operating lease right of use ROU assets other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Finance leases are included in property and equipment other current liabilities and other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments We use the implicit rate when readily determinable The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term We have lease agreements with lease and non lease components which are generally accounted for separately For certain equipment leases such as vehicles we account for the lease and non lease components as single lease component Additionally for certain equipment leases we apply portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below its carrying value Intangible Assets All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to 20 years We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired Recent Tax Legislation On December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA was enacted into law which significantly changes existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business Refer to Note 13 Income Taxes for further discussion 63 PART II Item As result of the TCJA we have recast certain prior period income tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation Previously reported balances were impacted as follows In millions As Previously Reported As Adjusted Balance Sheets June 30 2017 Long term income taxes 13 485 Other long term liabilities 17 034 549 These adjustments had no impact in our consolidated income statements or net cash from or used in operating financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements Recent Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Comprehensive Income Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects In February 2018 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 we remeasured our deferred taxes related to unrealized gains on our investment balances using the reduced tax rate As required by GAAP we recognized the net tax benefit in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements even though the deferred taxes were initially recognized in AOCI which resulted in stranded tax effects We elected to early adopt the standard effective April 2018 and reclassified 42 million net tax benefit from AOCI to retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheets Adoption of the standard had no impact to our consolidated income statements or cash flows statements Leases In February 2016 the FASB issued new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases Under the standard disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases We are also required to recognize and measure leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using modified retrospective approach with certain practical expedients available We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition We elected the available practical expedients and implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption The standard had material impact in our consolidated balance sheets but did not have an impact in our consolidated income statements The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged Adoption of the standard required us to restate certain previously reported results including the recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases Refer to Impacts to Previously Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard in our consolidated financial statements Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014 the FASB issued new standard related to revenue recognition Under the standard revenue is recognized when customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services In addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers 64 PART II Item We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 2017 using the full retrospective method which required us to restate each prior reporting period presented We implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption The most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue Specifically for Windows 10 we recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device For certain multi year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and SA we recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard depends on contract specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing Revenue recognition related to our hardware cloud offerings such as Office 365 LinkedIn and professional services remains substantially unchanged Adoption of the standard using the full retrospective method required us to restate certain previously reported results including the recognition of additional revenue and an increase in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition In addition adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long term assets driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and SA reduction of unearned revenue driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi year commercial software subscriptions and an increase in deferred income taxes driven by the upfront recognition of revenue Refer to Impacts to Previously Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard in our consolidated financial statements Impacts to Previously Reported Results Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases impacted our previously reported results as follows In millions except per share amounts As Previously Reported New Revenue Standard Adjustment As Restated Income

liabilities 23 464 26 183 24 621 Stockholders' equity 72 394 15 317 87 711 Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases had no impact to cash from or used in operating financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017 the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2019 with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date Adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems Income Taxes Intra Entity Asset Transfers In October 2016 the FASB issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party This guidance is effective for us beginning July 2018 with early adoption permitted beginning July 2017 We plan to adopt the guidance effective July 2018 Adoption of the guidance will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date We currently expect net cumulative effect adjustment of approximately 550 million which will reverse the deferral of income tax consequences from past intra entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current GAAP partially offset by deferred tax liability related to global intangible low taxed income GILTI Adoption of the standard is expected to result in an increase in long term deferred tax assets of billion an increase in long term deferred tax liabilities of billion and reduction to other current assets of 150 million As result of the TCJA we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems Financial Instruments Credit Losses In June 2016 the FASB issued new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates We will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables loans and other financial instruments Credit losses relating to available for sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2020 with early adoption permitted beginning July 2019 Adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems 66 PART II Item Financial Instruments Recognition Measurement Presentation and Disclosure In January 2016 the FASB issued new standard related to certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments with certain exceptions to be recognized through net income rather than OCI Under the standard equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair value are eligible for the measurement alternative Using the measurement alternative investments without readily determinable fair values will be valued at cost with adjustments for changes in price or impairments reflected through net income The standard will be effective for us beginning July 2018 Adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment from AOCI to retained earnings as of the effective date cumulative effect adjustment will capture any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost In preparation for adoption of this standard we have implemented internal controls to align with the new standard and have concluded that we will elect the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values The impact in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption will not be material Adoption of the standard will have no impact to cash from or used in operating financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements NOTE EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method

related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing eliminating and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment All notional amounts presented below are measured in dollar equivalents Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions Option and forward contracts are used to hedge portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments Principal currencies hedged include the euro Japanese yen British pound Canadian dollar and Australian dollar As of June 30 2018 and 2017 the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were billion and billion respectively Foreign currency risks related to certain non dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments As of June 30 2018 and 2017 the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were billion and billion respectively Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign

billion and 13 billion respectively As of June 30 2017 the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were billion and 10 billion respectively Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk Market price risk is managed relative to broad based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments options futures and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments From time to time to hedge our price risk we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments including puts calls swaps and forwards As of June 30 2018 the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were 49 million and million respectively As of June 30 2017 the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were billion and billion respectively of which billion and billion

Tax Legislation On December 22 2017 the TCJA was enacted into law which significantly changes existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business such as imposing one time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income reducing the federal statutory tax rate and adopting territorial tax system The TCJA required us to incur one time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to income tax at rate of 15 for foreign cash and certain other net current assets and on the remaining income The TCJA also reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 2018 For fiscal year 2018 our blended federal statutory tax rate is 28 This is the result of using the tax rate of 35 for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21 for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 The TCJA includes provision to tax global intangible low taxed income GILTI of foreign subsidiaries and base erosion anti abuse tax BEAT measure that taxes certain payments between corporation and its foreign subsidiaries The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning July 2018 The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 As of June 30 2018 we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA During fiscal year 2018 we recorded provisional net charge of 13 billion related to the TCJA based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the TCJA the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the TCJA collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance issued by the Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service IRS FASB and other standard setting and regulatory bodies Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made Our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date The impacts of our estimates are described further below During fiscal year 2018 we recorded an estimated net charge of 13 billion related to the TCJA due to the impact of the one time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of 17 billion offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of billion primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities We recorded an estimated 17 billion charge in fiscal year 2018 related to the transition tax which was included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets We have not yet completed our accounting for the transition tax as our analysis of deferred foreign income is not complete To calculate the transition tax we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal year 2018 because these tax returns are not complete or due Fiscal year 2018 taxable income will be known once the respective tax returns are completed and filed In addition and foreign audit settlements may significantly impact the estimated transition tax The impact of the and foreign audits on the transition tax will be known as the audits are concluded 81 PART II Item In addition we recorded an estimated billion benefit in fiscal year 2018 from the impact of changes in the tax rate primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities which was included in provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and deferred income taxes and long term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets We remeasured our deferred taxes to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods The TCJA subjects corporation to tax on its GILTI Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of GAAP Under GAAP we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes We elected the deferred method and the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the table of deferred income tax assets and liabilities below On August 2018 the Internal Revenue Service published on its website proposed regulations relating to the transition tax imposed by the TCJA Once published in the Federal Register the proposed regulations are subject to 60 day comment period Final regulations are expected to be issued after consideration

Impacts of TCJA 37 Phone business losses Excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation Interest net Other reconciling items net Effective rate 54 14 19 The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions Our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland Singapore and Puerto Rico which are taxed at rates lower than the rate generated 87 76 and 91 of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016

significant other reconciling items The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017 The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the and foreign countries

agreement to acquire Nokia Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre trial proceedings the remaining cases are stayed In separate 2009 decision the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines FCC Guidelines are pre empted by federal law The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect The lawsuits also allege an industry wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines In 2013 the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies In 2014 the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to exclude the plaintiffs general causation experts The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals heard en banc In October 2016 the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and
